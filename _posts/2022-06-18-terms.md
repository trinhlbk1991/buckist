# End User License Agreement

**The license's scope** The legitimate acquirer of Buckist ("you") is granted a usage right for this App by Buckist. This is a personal license. The App can only be used on the device that was used to download and install it. The App's objective is to provide a social networking service, but users are allowed to use Buckist for any reason they like, as long as they stay within the bounds of these terms and conditions and the law.

It's not allowed:

- to supply copies of the App to third parties; 
- to sublicense the App or make the App available to third parties, whether through rental, Software-as-a-Service constructs, or otherwise; 
- to modify the App, except to the extent permitted by mandatory law; 
- to remove or make unreadable notices of Buckist as copyright holder of the App.

You can save a copy of the App as a backup. However, you may not use or share the backup copy on its own, unless it is used in conjunction with the original App. In addition to the terms and conditions set forth in this agreement, Google's Play Store may impose additional terms for the purchase and use of the App, as well as in-app purchases and other relevant concerns. See the terms of use and privacy statement of Google's Play Store, as well as other terms and conditions mentioned on this third party's website, for more information.

**Intellectual property** is something that belongs to you. Buckist owns and controls all rights to the App, its related documentation, and all modifications and expansions to it. You only get the rights and permissions that come with this agreement or that are explicitly provided in writing. Except as expressly permitted, you may not use, copy, or publish the App. Third-party open source software is included in the App. Under the applicable open source licenses, their respective rights holders provide you a usage right. The documentation contains this information. This end user licensing agreement does not apply to this open source software, and nothing in it should be considered as limiting or negating any right you have under an appropriate open source license.

**Consideration** The right of use is provided free of charge.

**In-app purchases** Buckist allows you to buy things while you're using the app. Buckist relies on the payment systems operated by"Google Inc.", to perform such in-app payments. When this payment mechanism has confirmed payment, Buckist is only required to complete an in-app purchase. You acknowledge that under the Distance Selling Act, you have no right to rescind or cancel in-app transactions. In-app purchases may be made in order to enhance the App's functionality. 

**Personal data** The App processes your personal data. For more information consult the privacy statement, please visit [https://icedtealabs.com/buckist/2022/06/18/privacy-policy/](https://icedtealabs.com/buckist/2022/06/18/privacy-policy/).

**Updates** Buckist publishes updates on a regular basis that may address bugs or improve the App's functionality. You will be notified of available updates via  Google's Play Store alerts, but it is your duty to check these notifications. Updates are carried out in a similar manner through various platforms, which necessitates the use of an active internet connection. You must give your permission to install updates separately. The availability and proper functioning of Google's Play Store, over which Buckist has no influence, are required for proper update application. Buckist is not liable or responsible for erroneous update execution.

**Support** You are completely responsible for downloading, installing, and activating the App as well as the Web service that goes with it. You can leave feedback on the App through Google's Play Store, and Buckist will review it and contact you if necessary.

**Liability and Guarantees** Buckist guarantees that Buckist contains no viruses, backdoors, or malicious routines; that Buckist violates no third-party rights (such as copyrights), excluding any violations arising out of a specific use of the App; and that it will use its best efforts to investigate any reported bugs as soon as practicable and to repair or create a workaround (Buckist may delay repairing bugs with limited impact until the next scheduled update); but nothing else. Except in circumstances of willful misconduct, gross negligence, or breach of a guarantee made herein, Buckist is not liable to you for any damages arising from your use of Buckist, regardless of the cause. If losses are not reported to Buckist promptly after discovery, there is no liability.  Furthermore, if the cause of the damage is beyond Buckist's control, there is no culpability (force majeure). To deliver the full service, the App talks with an Buckist-controlled server over the internet. Buckist takes every attempt to keep this server up and running at all times, but offers no guarantees. Buckist may perform server updates from time to time, which may result in a brief outage. Buckist will make every effort to notify you of any unavailability in advance. The server is covered by everything in this manual about updates, support, and liability.

**Term of the agreement** This agreement takes effect when you first use the App and continues until you stop using it. Both you and Buckist may terminate the agreement at any time by giving one month's notice. If you declare bankruptcy, seek for a payment suspension, have your assets seized, die, or go into liquidation, legal dissolution, or winding-up, this agreement will automatically and immediately cease. You shall stop using Buckist immediately when the agreement is terminated (for whatever reason). You must also delete all copies of Buckist (including backup copies) from all computer systems under your control.
